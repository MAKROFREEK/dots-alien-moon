===========================
I was browsing r/unixporn and saw a rice/background that really caught my eye. This is the result of that.

I thought this was really really cool.  https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/p0b4oh/qtile_light_purple_my_first_time/

I AM MAKING AN INSTALL GUIDE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS BECAUSE OF MY REALLY WEIRD AND WONKY SETTINGS.

**Dependencies**:

* Kitty *(alternatively I can provide color confs for any terminal if requested)*

* Dunst

* Polybar

* Discord

* BetterDiscord

* betterlockscreen

* i3lock-fancy

* i3-gaps

* rofi

* picom-ibhagwan-git

**Other tools I use**:

* Sublime

* Spotify

* Thunar

* Zathura

* Neovim

## Boot 

I provided a grub theme (mostly just colors but hey its consistent with the theme)

If you're not comfortable changing this I wouldn't even bother. It's a bit of a hassle.
